# CS-Project
This is our midterm project for CLPS0950.
Our proposal can be accessed with this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10RujP7LPyngtEgh2yr1tTahU-b8GROM765123ph1O5U/edit?usp=sharing

Our project is composed of 3 parts:
First, we went through the workshop and tutorials for EEGLAB and manipulated tutorial and real raw data based on our learnings from the tutorial.
Second, we created a script that automated preprocessing for any given EEG data without using the graphical interface of EEGLab toolbox.
Third, we created a script that produces a unique color per participant based on their unique EEG data (brainwave pattern).

During the first part of our project where we learned the tutorial. Since our work consisted of manipulating the existing functions within the EEGLab toolbox, we did not push our work into Github.

During the second part of our project where we created an automated processing script, we tried to push the code to Github. However, the code did not work when it was committed since our data came from a local folder and moving it to Github caused the function to lose its input data. We also could not push our input data into Github because it exceeded the Github file size limit.

During the initial parts of the third part of our project where we created a unique color producing script, we were unable to create a function. Thus, we wrote a script that could be implemented as a command after opening the EEGLab toolbox. We wrote the command script on a shared google doc which is linked below. After we succesfully created the command script, we converted the script into a function. However, similar to the issues we faced on the second part of the project, we were not able to commit our script into Github because our data came from a local folder and moving it to Github caused the function to lose its input.

Overall, our code works within our local computers and we have attached below a video that we created, which explains how to run our code. This was necessary since our input data is contained in a local folder and isn't accessible to outside coders.

Note: Since both parts on the final code were put into one script, and the codes weren't commites we will be putting down our individual hours below, who wrote the sections, who debugged, and the time it took

Who wrote each section: 
Selin and Jessica: wrote code from a = EEG.data ... imshow(unique_color) and debugged, 4 hours each (3/9-3/10)
Jay:
